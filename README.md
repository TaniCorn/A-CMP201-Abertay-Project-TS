 This project was for my CMP201 Project at Abertay 2021 Y2 T1.

 This was a fun little project where I mostly experimented with A* pathfinding. Making use of different data structures to find effiecient ones for different cases. The more recent changes were rushed and not so clean, due to deadlines. 
 While working on this I had also developed a Vector2 class, I initially heard of operator overloading and thought I should try making a Vector2 class. Little did I know how hard that would be, but I'm happy to say that it mostly works, the other parts I haven't tested.
 
 This project will be archived from 7th January 2022, as I have to finish it by then(not my deadline but I will not have access to wifi or computers for the next couple days/week.
